  <strong>Translation</strong>: "If you don't study, you'll flunk the exam. He flunked math in the first semester. The professor flunked the students because he was in a bad mood."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: flunk<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: to fail an exam, test, or course; to give someone a failing grade. Mainly used in academic/educational contexts (schools, universities, exams, tests, courses). More informal and colloquial than "fail". Not fully interchangeable with "fail" - "fail" is more general and can be used in many contexts (business, relationships, etc.), while "flunk" is specifically for academic failure<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
  I'm worried I might flunk the chemistry exam tomorrow.<br />
  She flunked her driving test three times before passing.<br />
  The professor flunked half the class because they didn't study.<br />
  The professor flunked those students because he was in a bad mood.<br />
  If you don't complete the assignment, you'll flunk this course.
