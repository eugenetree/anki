  <strong>Translation</strong>: "I sense you're discussing my client."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: sense (not feel)<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: to perceive or detect something through intuition or subtle cues (едва заметные намеки), without direct evidence; to become aware of something that isn't explicitly stated. While "sense" and "feel" can overlap in intuitive contexts, "sense" emphasizes detecting/perceiving through subtle signals (more analytical), while "feel" is broader and includes physical sensations, emotions, and opinions. Use "sense" when you want to emphasize perception through subtle cues.<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
  I sensed tension in the room as soon as I walked in.<br />
  She sensed that something was wrong with her friend.<br />
  He could sense danger approaching even before he saw anything.<br />
  The dog sensed his owner's sadness and came to comfort him.
