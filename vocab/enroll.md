  <strong>Translation</strong>: "I decided to enroll in a programming course next month. To enroll in this program, you need to fill out an online form."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: enroll<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: to officially register or sign up to become a member of a course, school, or organization. This is the final step after being accepted - you "apply to" a program first (seeking admission), then you "enroll in" it after acceptance (officially joining as a member)<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
