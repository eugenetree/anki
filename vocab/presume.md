**Front**: "Я <u>припускаю</u>, що він запізниться на зустріч через пробки."

**Back**:

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Translation</strong>: "I presume he will be late for the meeting because of traffic."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: presume<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: to suppose that something is true based on probability or reasonable grounds, without having definite proof; to assume something is likely<br /><br />
  <strong>Difference</strong>: <em>Presume</em> implies you have some reasonable evidence or grounds to believe something (more confident). <em>Assume</em> means taking something as true without proof (can be arbitrary). <em>Suppose</em> is more tentative and uncertain, suggesting a possibility rather than likelihood.<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
  I presume you've already eaten dinner since it's so late.<br />
  The detective presumed the suspect was guilty based on the evidence.<br />
  We can presume that the package will arrive tomorrow as scheduled.
