  <strong>Translation</strong>: "Can you heat up the soup? It's already cold. It's heating up in here - please open the window. The situation is heating up between the two teams."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: heat up<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: (1) to make something hot or warm (especially food); (2) to become hot or warm (as in a room or place getting warmer); (3) to become more intense, exciting, or tense (figurative)<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />

  <strong>Note</strong>: "Heat up" and "warm up" are similar but have subtle differences. "Heat up" typically means to make something hot or very warm (often to a higher temperature), while "warm up" usually means to make something moderately warm or to prepare for an activity. For food, they can sometimes be used interchangeably, but "heat up" suggests a higher temperature. "Warm up" is also commonly used for physical activities (e.g., "warm up before exercising").
