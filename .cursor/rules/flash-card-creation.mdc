# Flash Card Creation Guidelines

When creating flash cards for English learning, follow this specific format:

## User Context

- **Native Language**: Ukrainian
- **Learning Language**: English
- **Learning Approach**: Ukrainian sentence → English word/phrase with explanation

## REQUIRED File Structure

**CRITICAL**: Every flash card file MUST follow this exact markdown structure:

```
# Flash Card: [English Word/Phrase]

## Front

[1st Ukrainian sentence with <u>underlined word/phrase</u>]
[2nd Ukrainian sentence with <u>underlined word/phrase</u>]

## Back

<div id="back">
  <strong>Translation</strong>: "English translation"<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: target word/phrase<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: definition in English<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
  First example sentence.<br />
  Second example sentence.<br />
  Third example sentence.
</div>
```

**Reference**: See `vocab/turn-up.md` for the exact format example.

## Flash Card Format

### Front Side (Ukrainian)

- Contains a Ukrainian sentence that is **entirely in Ukrainian** (never include English words)
- **Underline the Ukrainian word/phrase** that corresponds to/translates to the target English vocabulary
- The underlined Ukrainian word/phrase is what the learner will translate to English
- The sentence should provide context for understanding the meaning
- Use natural, everyday Ukrainian language
- Make the sentence meaningful and relatable

### Back Side (English)

Must include four components:

1. **English Translation**: Complete English translation of the Ukrainian sentence from the front side
2. **English Word/Phrase**: The target vocabulary item
3. **Explanation**: Definition or explanation in English (preferably in English, not Ukrainian)
4. **Example Sentences**: 2-3 example sentences in English showing proper usage

## Example Format

This is how the file should look:

```
# Flash Card: Challenging

## Front

Я хочу вивчити нову мову, але це дуже <u>складно</u>. (not difficult)

## Back

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Translation</strong>: "I want to learn a new language, but it's very challenging."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: challenging (not difficult)<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: difficult in a way that tests your ability or determination<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
  Learning a new language can be challenging at first.<br />
  The math problem was quite challenging for the students.<br />
  She found the job interview challenging but rewarding.
</div>
```

## HTML Structure for Anki

When creating flash cards, use this HTML structure for the back side to ensure proper formatting in Anki:

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Translation</strong>: "English translation of the Ukrainian
  sentence."<br /><br />
  <strong>Word</strong>: target word/phrase<br /><br />
  <strong>Explanation</strong>: definition or explanation in English<br /><br />
  <strong>Examples</strong>:<br />
  First example sentence.<br />
  Second example sentence.<br />
  Third example sentence.
</div>

### HTML Structure Guidelines

- **Use `<div style="text-align: left;">`** to wrap the entire back content for left alignment
- **Use `<strong>` tags** for labels (Translation, Word, Explanation, Examples)
- **Use `<br><br>`** for spacing between sections
- **Use `<br>`** for line breaks between example sentences
- **Do NOT use quotes** around example sentences
- **Do NOT use `<ul><li>`** structure - use simple line breaks instead
- **Keep it simple** - avoid complex HTML that might not render properly in Anki

## Guidelines

- Focus on practical, commonly used English vocabulary
- Ensure Ukrainian sentences are grammatically correct and natural
- Provide clear, concise English explanations
- Include diverse example sentences showing different contexts
- Prioritize words/phrases that are commonly used in daily conversation

## File Creation

- **DO NOT** put flash cards directly in the chat response
- **ALWAYS** create a separate file in the `vocab/` directory for each flash card
- Use descriptive filenames based on the English word/phrase being learned
- Each file should contain the complete flash card format (Front and Back sides)
- As en example of the text format the "turn-up.md" file can be used

## Translation Accuracy

- **Direct Translation**: If the Ukrainian text doesn't have a very explicit English translation, either:
  - Find another Ukrainian example with a more suitable and direct translation, OR
  - Add hints in brackets after the Ukrainian sentence on the front side to clarify the intended meaning (e.g., "(not difficult)") in case with "challenging"
- **Multiple Meanings**: When an English word/phrase has multiple meanings, ALWAYS clarify with the user which context they want
  - Example: "work out" could mean exercising OR calculating - ask which context is intended
  - Wait for user clarification before creating the flash card
  - **If user requests multiple meanings**: Create a single flash card with multiple Ukrainian sentences on the front (one for each meaning), each with its own underlined word/phrase that corresponds to the different contexts
    - On the back, include all translations, explain all meanings in the Explanation section (numbered if needed), and provide 3-4 example sentences covering all the requested meanings
    - Example: "turn up" meaning both "arrive/appear" and "be found/discovered" - use two Ukrainian sentences with different verbs (з'явився, знайшлися) that each point to one of the English meanings
- **Context Clarity**: Ensure the Ukrainian sentence clearly points to the intended English meaning

## Ukrainian Sentence Quality

- **Avoid Similar Words**: Do NOT use Ukrainian words in the same sentence that have similar meanings to the target English word/phrase
  - Example: Don't use "не здавайся" (don't give up) in a sentence about "hang in" since they convey similar meanings
  - This creates confusion and doesn't provide clear context for the target vocabulary
- **Use Hints Sparingly**: Only add hints in brackets when the Ukrainian sentence doesn't clearly indicate the intended English meaning
  - If the Ukrainian sentence naturally points to the English word/phrase, hints are unnecessary
  - Remove hints when the context is already clear from the sentence structure and vocabulary choice
- **Natural Context**: Create Ukrainian sentences that naturally lead to the English word/phrase without forcing the connection
